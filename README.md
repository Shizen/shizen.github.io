This is the landing page on github for making sites dedicated/related to or describing a project, or in this case a user (me).  The overall system is called `GitHub Pages`.  So this page should be all about me :tm:... As I relate to github.  or something.

GitHub Pages:

`GitHub Pages` uses [`jekyll`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) as its static site constructor which in turn uses [`liquid`](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) to do some limited dynamic content.  Since github claims `jekyll` does no server-side anything (seems likely as a design constraint), one presumes Liquid is entirely client-side scripting.  The system is similar in design to `sites` (less many features, plus many users ;).

It seems to take 1+ minutes for the associated github.io page to update.  The documentation implies there's some complication going on, although thus far I haven't encountered any particularly description thereof.  GFM does not provide any toc afaik, and neither does Jekyll, although it's conceivable that some liquid shim might be able to manage it, along with a custom style sheet or layout.  Also note that while Jekyll allows for [tag filter plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) **these will not run on GitHub Pages**.  See all `--safe` (which is the option GitHub Pages is leveraging to disable plugins).

(Wouldn't it be nice to have a nice fieldset tag?  Shinmark does... sigh)

((of course, the styling of this theme overrides the default fieldset look anyway))

<fieldset>
  <legend>Blog Tests:</legend>  
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        {{ post.excerpt }}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</fieldset>

Categories:  
{% for category in site.categories %}
  <h3>{{ category[0] }}</h3>
  <ul>
    {% for post in category[1] %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
