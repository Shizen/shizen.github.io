# Projects

- `Sites` : My custom CMS system based on Node/Express, Discourse, SQLite, JSON Schema, Code Mirror and the Shinmark and TBA systems.
- `Shinmark` : My markdown dialect
- `TBA` : Working title coined by MadCap to talk about something I hadn't really named, but basically goes back to OpenDoc days.  The ability to make composited documents via various rules.

- `shinzen`
- `shinstrap`
- `shin-jsdoc`
