# Projects

- `Sites` : My custom CMS system based on Node/Express, Discourse, SQLite, JSON Schema, Code Mirror and the Shinmark and TBA systems.
- `Shinmark` : My markdown dialect
- `TBA` : Working title coined by MadCap to talk about something I hadn't really named, but basically goes back to OpenDoc days.  The ability to make composited documents via various rules.

- `shinzen`
- `shinstrap`
- `shin-jsdoc`
- `vscext-jsdoc-view`
- `vscext-underscore-tmpl-colorizer` (That's not what it's currently named).
- `vscext-pvtExtMgr`
- `vscext-shinmark`

GitHub Pages definitely allows local linking via usual markdown syntax.  Further, it will render linked markdown pages.  There ought to be a document somewhere that described better what GitHub Pages will do but...  It *does* seem oriented towards taking directly a jsdoc derived `docs/` directory containing straight up html.  Of course, from github's perspective that's not really jsdoc specific, just a general pattern.
